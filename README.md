### Hi there 👋

I'm Guillaume Thirard, a senior PHP 🐘 developer / tech-leader. I'm working with PHP since 2011 and I like it 😎

I'm currently in a trip arround the world 🌎 since the 15th of august 2022. 
Before this trip I was a freelance and I worked at [Bedrock](https://www.bedrockstreaming.com/) (ex M6Web) in 📍 Lyon as senior backend developer.
